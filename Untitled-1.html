    <h2>A Brief History of Middle Eastern Civilizations</h2>
    <div class="content-section">
      <h3>Ancient Roots</h3>
      <p>The Middle East was home to the earliest complex societies: Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), Persia (Iran), and the Arabian Peninsula. These regions pioneered writing (cuneiform), early mathematics, law codes, and astronomical observation, laying foundations for later scientific progress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h3>The Rise of Knowledge - Islamic Golden Age (8th - 14th c.)</h3>
      <p>From roughly the 8th to the 14th century, cities such as Baghdad, Cairo, Cordoba, and Damascus became international centers of learning. Scholars translated, preserved, and extended Greek, Persian, and Indian knowledge while making original advances in mathematics, medicine, optics, geography, and engineering.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>House of Wisdom (Baghdad): translation, astronomy, mathematics.</li>
        <li>Córdoba & Cairo: hospitals, libraries, and medical training.</li>
        <li>Centers encouraged cross-cultural exchange across Europe, Africa, and Asia.</li>

    <h2>Impact on Society - Before and After</h2>
    <div class="content-section">
      <h3>Before</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mathematics, astronomy, and medicine were often limited and intertwined with myth or fragmented traditions.</li>
        <li>Optics and vision were poorly understood; practical medicine lacked systematic texts and training.</li>
        <li>Navigation and cartography were imprecise; long-distance trade and exploration were constrained by poor maps.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h3>After</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Algebra, Arabic numerals, and algorithmic thinking enabled advances in engineering, commerce, and later computing.</li>
        <li>Ibn al-Haytham's experimental approach modernized optics; Avicenna's Canon systematized medicine for centuries.</li>
        <li>Accurate maps (Al-Idrisi and others) improved navigation, trade, and sparked European exploration.</li>

          <h3>Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen)</h3>
          <p class="bio"><strong>Fields:</strong> Optics, experimental method, astronomy.</p>
          <p class="bio">Ibn al-Haytham transformed the study of optics by insisting on controlled observation and experiments. His Book of Optics (Kitab al-Manazir) examined reflection, refraction, the anatomy of the eye, and optical illusions. He famously used the camera obscura to explain how images form and argued that vision results from light striking the eye. His work helped establish empirical methods foundational to modern science.</p>
          <p class="bio"><strong>Notable:</strong> Introduced systematic experimentation; influenced later European scientists.</p>

          <h3>Al-Khwarizmi</h3>
          <p class="bio"><strong>Fields:</strong> Mathematics, astronomy.</p>
          <p class="bio">Often called the father of algebra, Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi wrote foundational texts such as Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala. His works introduced systematic techniques for solving linear and quadratic equations and helped spread the Hindu–Arabic numeral system across the Islamic world and into Europe. The term "algorithm" derives from the Latinized form of his name.</p>
          <p class="bio"><strong>Notable:</strong> Algebraic methods, algorithmic thinking, and numerical notation that shaped computation.</p>

          <h3>Avicenna (Ibn Sina)</h3>
          <p class="bio"><strong>Fields:</strong> Medicine, philosophy.</p>
          <p class="bio">Avicenna's Canon of Medicine (Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb) is a multi-volume medical encyclopedia that synthesized Greek, Persian, and Islamic medical knowledge. It organized diseases, treatments, and pharmacology into a standardized reference used in medical schools for centuries. Avicenna also wrote on logic, metaphysics, and natural philosophy, bridging classical thought and later scholastic traditions.</p>
          <p class="bio"><strong>Notable:</strong> Canon used as a standard medical text in Europe and the Islamic world for 500+ years.</p>

          <h3>Al-Idrisi</h3>
          <p class="bio"><strong>Fields:</strong> Geography, cartography.</p>
          <p class="bio">Al-Idrisi produced one of the most comprehensive medieval world maps—the Tabula Rogeriana—commissioned by King Roger II of Sicily. His geographic compendium combined travelers' reports and earlier maps into a detailed picture of the known world, greatly improving navigation and geographic knowledge in both the Islamic and European worlds.</p>
          <p class="bio"><strong>Notable:</strong> Tabula Rogeriana, influential medieval atlas used by navigators.</p>
